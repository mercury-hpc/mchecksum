What is mchecksum?
==================

MChecksum is a generic checksum library.

Please see the accompanying COPYING file for license details.

Supported platforms
===================

Linux / MacOS / Windows

Documentation
=============

Please see the documentation available on the mercury [website][documentation]
for a quick introduction to mchecksum.

Software requirements
=====================

CRC32 and Adler32 checksums require ZLIB to be installed on your system.
CRC32C can be used with or without HW acceleration -- SSE4.2 acceleration
requires the SSE4.2 instruction set to be supported by your CPU, improved
performance can be achieved using the Intel(R) [ISA-L][isal] library but
requires the PCLMULQDQ instruction to be supported by your CPU as well as
this library to be installed on your system.

Building
========

If you install the full sources, put the tarball in a directory where you
have permissions (e.g., your home directory) and unpack it:

    gzip -cd mchecksum-X.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   or

    bzip2 -dc mchecksum-X.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -

Replace "X" with the version number of the package.

MChecksum makes use of the CMake build-system and requires that you do an
out-of-source build. In order to do that, you must create a new build
directory and run the 'ccmake' command from it:

    cd mchecksum-X
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ccmake .. (where ".." is the relative path to the mchecksum-X directory)

Type 'c' multiple times and choose suitable options. Recommended options are:

    BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                ON (or OFF if the library you link
                                     against requires static libraries)
    BUILD_TESTING                    ON
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /path/to/install/directory
    MCHECKSUM_USE_ISAL               OFF (Optional)
    MCHECKSUM_USE_SSE4_2             ON
    MCHECKSUM_USE_ZLIB               OFF (Optional)

Setting include directory and library paths may require you to toggle to
the advanced mode by typing 't'. Once you are done and do not see any
errors, type 'g' to generate makefiles. Once you exit the CMake
configuration screen and are ready to build the targets, do:

    make

(Optional) Verbose compile/build output:

This is done by inserting "VERBOSE=1" in the "make" command. E.g.:

    make VERBOSE=1

Installing
==========

Assuming that the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX has been set (see previous step)
and that you have write permissions to the destination directory, do
from the build directory:

    make install

Testing
=======

CTest is used to run the tests, simply run from the build directory:

    ctest .

(Optional) Verbose testing:

This is done by inserting "-V" in the "ctest" command.  E.g.:

    ctest -V .

Extra verbose information can be displayed by inserting "-VV". E.g.:

    ctest -VV .
